## 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

## 2) Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

## 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

## 4) labels the data set with descriptive variable names

## 5) Creates tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
